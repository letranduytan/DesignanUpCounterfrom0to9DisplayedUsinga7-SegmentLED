# 🔢 LED 7-Segment Counter: From 0 to 9

Final project for the **Digital Electronics** course – Faculty of Advanced Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology – The University of Danang.

## 📖 Overview

This project aims to **design, simulate, and implement** both a **synchronous** and **asynchronous** up counter that displays numbers from `0` to `9` using a **7-segment LED display**. It includes:

- A debounce circuit for the push-button
- Binary to 7-segment decoder logic
- Simulation using **Proteus**
- Real-world implementation on **breadboard**

**Instructor:** Dr. Lê Quốc Huy  
**Timeline:** April 22, 2024 – May 29, 2024

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Synchronous Counter** (all flip-flops share the same clock signal)
- ✅ **Asynchronous Counter** (flip-flops are chained)
- ✅ **7-Segment Decoder** using Karnaugh maps
- ✅ **Debounce circuit** to filter button bounce
- ✅ **Breadboard implementation**
- ✅ **Proteus simulation**

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. Push Button & Debounce
- The input signal is cleaned using a debounce circuit to ensure stable rising edges to trigger counting.

### 2. Counting Logic
- A 4-bit counter is built using **JK Flip-Flops** (74LS73).
- Two modes implemented:
  - **Synchronous counter**
  - **Asynchronous counter**

### 3. Decoder Logic
- 4-bit binary output is decoded into a 7-segment display pattern (a–g).
- Designed using **Karnaugh Maps** for simplified logic.

## 🧪 Simulation

- Designed and simulated using **Proteus Design Suite**.
- Visual confirmation of incrementing numbers upon each button press.
- Simulation files are included in the `/proteus/` directory.

---

## 🔌 Physical Circuit

- Implemented on a **breadboard** using real components.
- Powered with **5V DC**.
- Button press increments display from 0 → 9, then rolls over.

## 📝 Notes

- Ensure proper power supply (5V regulated).
- Resistors on LED segments are used to limit current.
- Flip-flops should be properly cleared/set before operation.
